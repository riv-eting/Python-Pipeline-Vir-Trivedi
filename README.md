# Python-Pipeline-Vir-Trivedi
This is my Python Pipeline project (Track 2) for Dr. Wheeler's COMP 383 course, section 001, but even better.
Hello and welcome to my Python Pipeline project GitHub! If you're looking for a fun time, you've come to the right place.
My name is Vir Trivedi, and I will be your tour guide through this wacky wrapper script journey that is Track 2 of our Python Pipeline project.

Prior to running the script, there are a few important things to go over and discuss. It is imperative you read this carefully for accurate instruction and understanding.

Included in this repository is a python script titled "pipeline_Trivedi.py". This is the wrapper script that you will be using to run the whole pipeline in one go. Pretty nifty, right?

Running this script is pretty simple and can be done via the command line by entering "python pipeline_Trivedi.py --input {insert filepath here}"

Additionally, there is a sample dataset included titled ________. The path for this dataset is _________. If you want to use this sample dataset to run the pipeline, write the file path in the command to run the script where it says {insert filepath here}.
